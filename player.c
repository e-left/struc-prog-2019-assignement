/*
Your job is to implement the player() function, so that everytime it returns a column number to play.
In every turn it takes the entire board struct pointer:

typedef struct {
    int rows;
    int columns;
    int** board;
} Board

Board.board is a two dimensional array declared somewhat like this: Board.board[rows][columns]

extern int player(const Board* b){
    //Happy hacking :)
}
